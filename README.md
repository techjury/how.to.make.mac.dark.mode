## How to Make Your Mac Even Darker

To make your Mac darker, click the Control Center icon in the top-right corner of your screen and select Display. Then click Dark Mode and Night Shift to turn them both on. While Dark Mode inverts the colors of certain apps, Night Shift makes your screen look less blue and more yellow.

You can also click Display Preferences at the bottom of the pop-up window. Then select Night Shift and drag the Color Temperature slider all the way to More Warm. This will further reduce the amount of blue light coming from your screen, which helps with eye strain, especially when reading text at night.
